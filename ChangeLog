	* README: revised to clarify the purpose of the files in the
	package.
	* f03gl_glut.f90: added to complete the f03gl_gl*.f90 set of
	routines.
	* Makefile: added -fno-range-check flag for gfortran.
	* A few minor corrections elsewhere.

2020-11-08  Anthony Stone  <ajs1@cam.ac.uk>

	* OpenGL_gl.f90 (OpenGL_GL) and f03gl_gl.f90: The transfer
	function is not accepted by gfortran v.10 and the int-function
	version causes an arithmetic overflow in gfortran v.7.5. Lines 553-4
	now changed to
        INTEGER(GLbitfield), PARAMETER :: GL_CLIENT_ALL_ATTRIB_BITS = -1 ! i.e. z'ffffffff'

2020-11-06  Anthony Stone  <ajs1@cam.ac.uk>

	* OpenGL_gl.f90 (OpenGL_GL) and f03gl_gl.f90:
	l.554:
	    transfer(z'ffffffff',GL_CURRENT_BIT)
	not accepted by gfortran 10. Changed to
	    int(z'ffffffff',kind=GL_CURRENT_BIT)
	All other BOZ constants have been changed from z'nnnnnnnn' to
	int(z'nnnnnnnn', kind=<kind>), where <kind> is 'GLenum' or
	'GLbitfield' or whatever GL kind is appropriate.

	Corrections:
	GLUT_fonts.c: #include "GL/glut.h" changed to #include "GLUT.h"
	Makefile: -lXext no longer required in X11LIB
	In Ubuntu 18.04 it was necessary to add symbolic links in
	/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/:
	sudo ln -s libGL.so.1 libGL.so
	sudo ln -s libGLU.so.1 libGLU.so

2018-01-09  Anthony Stone  <ajs1@cam.ac.uk>

	OpenGL_freeglut.f90 renamed as OpenGL_old_freeglut.f90
	New OpenGL_freeglut.f90 copied from f03gl_new_freeglut.f90,
	which is the version used by Orient.

	The BOZ constants in the form z'nnnn' in the ...glut.f90 files are
	not standard Fortran, though generally accepted as an extension.
	They have been changed to int(z'nnnn', kind=GLenum), which is
	accepted by the standard.

	OpenGL_{open,free}glut.nullfunc.f90: BOZ constants also changed here.

2014-08-01  Anthony Stone  <ajs1@cam.ac.uk>

	* h_interfaces.py: Handling of function return values corrected.
	"count=1" added to most re.sub calls. Other minor corrections.
	Printing to stdout suppressed unless the --verbose flag is specified.

2014-07-31  Anthony Stone  <ajs1@cam.ac.uk>

	* h_interfaces.py: first version of Python translation of
	h_interfaces.pl.

2013-08-06  Anthony Stone  <ajs1@cam.ac.uk>

	* index.html: Minor changes

	* f03gl/h_interfaces.pl, glut_interfaces.pl, Makefile, README:
	Copyright notices added.

	* new_freeglut.h and f03gl_new_freeglut.f90 added.

	1. Replaced CHARACTER by CHARACTER(C_CHAR) in spec_interfaces.pl.
	Also in h_interfaces.pl, h_interfaces.glutnullfunc.pl and
	glut_interfaces.pl, but haven't tested those.

	2. Replaced CHARACTER by CHARACTER(C_CHAR) directly in the various
	...glut.f90 files.

	3. Modified spec_interfaces.pl. to add the CString function at the
	end of the gl module.

	4. Modified spec_interfaces.pl to replace 0xffffffff by
	transfer(z'ffffffff',GL_CURRENT_BIT) rather than just z'ffffffff',
	which provokes an overflow error from gfortran. (GL_CURRENT_BIT is
	an arbitrary previously declared INTEGER(GL_bitfield) variable.)

	5. Added a blank line at the end of glu.spec, which overcomes the
	failure to declare objW.

	6. Regenerated OpenGL_gl.f90 and OpenGL_glu.f90 and diffed them
	with the old versions to check that spec.interfaces.pl has done
	the right thing.

	7. Changed the examples to use CString for string argments.

	8. Provided a gzipped tarfile of the package as well as the zip
	archive.

	9. Edited the web page. For convenience in maintenance, the web
	site no longer carries the individual files as well as the zipped
	package. The links to the individual files in the web page have
	been replaced by just the file names, but in a coloured font to
	indicate that they're in the package. Added acknowledgements to
	those who have sent suggestions (anonymous) and an acknowledgment
	to Dr Mitchell for the use of his example programs. Added more
	notes on the Nag and gfortran compilers.
